## the Begin of TyeolRik's Blog
It was difficult to begin my blog. Becuase I've never used these programs, which is named Ruby, Jekyll, GitHub, Disqus, Markdown etc. So, I dedicated myself to this with lots of Jekyll documents and blogs. 

> **This blog is aimed at newbie developer who just enter the world of programming like me.**

The reason why I open the blog is as in the following. **"Let's explain android, which I am learning now, more easily in Korean."** I, who has entered the world of android development, have a lot of question, curiosity and error which needs to be debugged. I cannot find the answer when I searched it in Korean. Even if I found the documents, it explained difficult to me. That means, it isn't easy for newbie.

> **I try very hard to speak in plain terms.**

I think that almost newbie developers use Microsoft Windows like me. (At least in my university, which I attend.) However, a lot of document(Stackoverflow, Github, blog or anything else) use MAC or linux that we don't use. Therefore, of course that commands, which they suggest, doesn't work on my CMD and I think that many newbies would despair of such moment. **The goal of my blog is to solve the problem** Also, I suppose it is the begin of saving my world to rescue newbies from hopelessness!
