## About

꿈 속에서 뱀이 온 몸을 휘감던 날, 작은 소년이 태어났습니다. 아주 평범한 소년이었습니다. 하지만, 그 소년에게는 큰 꿈이 있었습니다. 바로, 세상을 바꾸겠다는 것이었죠. "모든 사람이 원하는 삶을 살게 된다면 얼마나 좋을까?" 2017년, 그 꿈에 한 발자국 다가가기 위해서 블로그를 만들었습니다.
The day when a snake coiled around a woman in a dream, a little boy was born. He was just an ordinary boy. But, he had big dream. It is a hope to change his world. "How marvellous it would be if people could live as they want?" In 2017, he made a blog to be one step closer to his dream.
<!-- Github's Octocat was designed by Simon Oxley, alongside the white bird Twitter used (before they received a proper logo) as part of a usual routine of cranking out images for iStock. GitHub saw it, and wanted it, presumably under the notion that it can represent how complex code combines to create peculiar things, much like the octopuss... except the CEO of GitHub called it an octocat, and it has been the octocat since--> <!-- <a href="https://www.quora.com/GitHub/What-is-the-story-behind-GitHub%E2%80%99s-octocat-mascot" target="_blank">[via]</a>. -->
